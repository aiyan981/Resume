      <p>Dear Recruitment Officer,</p>
      <p>
        I am a third year Computer Science student at York University.
        My anticipated graduation date is April, 2022.
        I am seeking a Co-op/ Internship and I am prepared to relocate if necessary.
        I am very interested to work in the Computer Science field, as it serves my keen interest in computer programming and my passion for technology.
      </p>
      <p>Over the years, I have worked on various school projects in Java and Android application.
        I have a strong command over the Java language which I have developed through a lot of practise and dedication.
        I created many android apps using Android Studio and Java (Please visit my GitHub account- <a href="https://github.com/aiyan981/">https://github.com/aiyan981/</a> to view my projects).
        I have been coding in Java for 3 years and I have learnt many useful data structures (Trees, Linked List, Graphs) and searching algorithms.
        As for scripting language, I have experience scripting in Python and it is one of my favourite coding languages. I know how to loop and iterate and read files in Python. For data structures in Python, I can create and work with lists, tuples and dictionary.
        Currently, aside from school work, I am in a Web Development Bootcamp. I can seamlessly create and design web pages. Please visit my personal website that I created- <a href="https://aiyan981.github.io/Personal-Website/">https://aiyan981.github.io/Personal-Website/</a>
        .Very soon I will be able to work on Front-End and Back-End web development. This summer 2020, I practised Java on LeetCode and I did online course on SQL.
        I can create and manipulate tables on SQL and perform complex queries. During my free time, I browse the internet for new technologies and I practise Java by solving problems on LeetCode.
        I also play soccer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through my past work experiences and team projects, I have had the opportunity to interact directly with a large and diverse group of co-workers
        because of which I have developed excellent communication skills.
        I am experienced in working in teams and I believe I have the ability to seamlessly integrate into any team.
        I am a hardworking and dedicated person who easily adapts to pressure and always plan my work to meet deadlines.
        I believe my qualifications and abilities would be a great asset to your firm.
        I look forward to having the pleasure of meeting and talking to you about the challenges of the position.
      </p>
      <p>Sincerely, <br>Aiyan Anowar <br>Bachelor of Computer Science Honours Major <br>York University </p>
